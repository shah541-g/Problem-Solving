# Problem Number: 1.3
# Problem Name: URLify
# Description: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
