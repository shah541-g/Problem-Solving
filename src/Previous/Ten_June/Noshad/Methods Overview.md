Methods Overview: Palindrome Permutation Checks
This document provides an overview of two Python functions designed to determine if a given string can be permuted to form a palindrome. Both functions achieve this in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string.

1. is_permutation_palindrome_using_hash_map(s: str) -> bool
Purpose
This function checks if the input string s can be rearranged to form a palindrome. It achieves this by counting the occurrences of each character using a hash map (dictionary).

Algorithm
Initialization: An empty dictionary, dic, is created to store character counts.

Character Counting:

The function iterates through each character in the input string s, converting it to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity.

Spaces are ignored.

For each valid character, its occurrence count is incremented in the dic. If a character is encountered for the first time, it's added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

Palindrome Check:

A boolean flag, isOddCountFound, is initialized to False.

The function then iterates through the counts (values) stored in dic.

For a string to be a permutation of a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd number of occurrences.

If an odd occurrence count is found:

If isOddCountFound is already True (meaning a second character with an odd count has been found), the function immediately returns False.

Otherwise, isOddCountFound is set to True.

Result: If the loop completes, it means at most one character had an odd count, so the function returns True.

Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the function iterates through the string once to build the hash map and then iterates through the (at most 26) characters in the hash map.

Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string. In the worst case (all unique characters), k can be up to 26 for English alphabet characters, making it O(1) effectively.

2. is_permutation_palindrome_using_set(s: str) -> bool
Purpose
This function also determines if the input string s can be rearranged to form a palindrome. It employs a set to track characters that appear an odd number of times.

Algorithm
Initialization: An empty set, odd_chars, is created.

Character Tracking:

The function iterates through each character in the input string s, converting it to lowercase.

Spaces are ignored.

For each valid character:

If the character is already present in odd_chars, it means it has appeared an even number of times up to this point (as it was added for its first occurrence and now removed for its second, or removed for its third and now added for its fourth, etc.). So, the character is removed from the set.

If the character is not in odd_chars, it means it has appeared an odd number of times (as it's being added for its first, third, fifth occurrence, etc.). So, the character is added to the set.

Palindrome Check:

After iterating through all characters, the odd_chars set will contain only those characters that appeared an odd number of times in the string.

For a string to be a permutation of a palindrome, the odd_chars set can contain at most one character (meaning len(odd_chars) must be 0 or 1).

The function returns True if len(odd_chars) <= 1, otherwise False.

Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the function iterates through the string once. Set operations (add, remove, check presence) on small character sets are typically O(1) on average.

Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters that appear an odd number of times. Similar to the hash map approach, k is at most 26 (for English alphabet characters), making it O(1) effectively.

Comparison of Approaches
Both methods successfully determine if a string can form a palindrome permutation with the same O(n) time complexity.

The hash map approach explicitly counts character frequencies and then checks how many characters have odd counts. This is intuitive as it directly reflects the definition of a palindrome permutation (at most one character can have an odd count).

The set approach implicitly tracks odd/even counts by adding and removing characters. If a character is in the set, its count is odd; if not, its count is even. This approach is often considered more concise and elegant for this specific problem due to the properties of sets.

Both are efficient and valid solutions, with the choice often coming down to personal preference or specific coding style guidelines.
