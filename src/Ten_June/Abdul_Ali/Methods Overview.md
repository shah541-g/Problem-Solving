## Implementation Details

The `PalindromePermutationCheckerByAbdulAli` class contains two methods to check if a string's characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome:

1. `isPalindromePossibleViaPermutationMethod1` - O(n) time complexity
2. `isPalindromePossibleViaPermutationMethod2` - O(n) time complexity

## Methods Overview

### 1. Frequency Count Approach

#### public boolean isPalindromePossibleViaPermutationMethod1(char[])

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1) (fixed 128-size array for ASCII)

    Description: Counts the frequency of each character in the string, ignoring spaces, and checks if there is at most one character with an odd frequency count. A palindrome permutation is possible if the number of characters with odd frequencies is ≤ 1.

    Limitation: Assumes ASCII characters (0-127).

### 2. Incremental Odd Count Approach

#### public boolean isPalindromePossibleViaPermutationMethod2(char[])

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1) (fixed 128-size array for ASCII)

    Description: Processes characters one by one, maintaining a count of characters with odd frequencies. Increments the count when a character's frequency becomes odd and decrements it when it becomes even. A palindrome permutation is possible if the final odd count is ≤ 1.

    Limitation: Assumes ASCII characters (0-127).

    Advantage: More efficient as it updates the odd count dynamically during the frequency calculation.
